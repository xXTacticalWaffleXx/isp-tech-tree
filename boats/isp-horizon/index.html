        The isp horizon is a relativley small carrier designed primarily for helicopters and vtols, although a skilled pilot can 
        land a conventional plane on its runway. <br>
        <br>
        The horizon has an extremely simple stabilisation system onboard comprised of some thrusters and an x-o-meter, the thrusters are
        activated if the meter ever reports more or less then zero, which it always will in the real world, this results in the carrier
        rocking alot however the system prevents the carrier from capsizing which the carrier will if left with the system off.<br>
        <br>
        The horizon has a single lifeboat with a maximum ocupancy of 6 located on the starboard side of the vessel located at the very 
        front, there is a small bridge used for boarding at the back of the vessel, there is also a ladder on the port side someone in
        the water can use to get onto the ship by clicking on the block seat at the top of the ladder. <br>
        <br>
        As of yet the horizon has not been sank due to all of its materials being independantly boyant with some exceptions, however
        the carrier is not very durable, infact it has rather little resistance to any sort of weaponry with no defensive weapons of its own
        the carrier relies entirely on air support and other boats deployed with it to defend it. as such deploying this boat with no support
        is a fools errand and if this boat is ever separated from its allys every possible effort must be made to return.<br>
